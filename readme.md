# CSSBattle - MuffinTheMan's Solutions

I took some ideas on how to get my solutions smaller from here: https://www.sarthakbatra.com/blog/getting-started-with-css-battle/. However, I'm not copying solutions from anyone else. These solutions are mine. I'm not so much in it to make the leaderboard as I am in it to exercise my own brain and have fun challenging myself! CSS is not exactly my strong suit, but I'm hoping doing challenges like this will make me better at it.

Note: these solutions are unminified. My actual submissions are minified, and the closing `}</style>` is ommitted.
